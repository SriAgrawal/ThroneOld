    <p>THRONE Privacy Policy This Privacy Policy describes how and when THRONE collects, uses, and shares your information when you use our Services. THRONE receives your information through our mobile applications, websites, email notifications, and other interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

    <p><b>Information Collection and Use</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Creating a THRONE Account and Profile Information:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>When you create a THRONE account, you must provide access credentials either in the form of an email address and password or by authentication using another service, such as Facebook or Twitter. You may optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a short bio, location, and profile picture. If you create your THRONE account by connecting through another service, we may use public information from that connected account to help complete your THRONE profile. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time. Profile information is available publicly on our Services, such as on your profile page.Contact Information: In addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may use this information to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and facilitate your use of the Services. We may use the contact information (such as your phone number or email address) to help connect you with other THRONE users, even if that information is not publicly displayed.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Content, Following, and other Public Information:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>THRONE is a picture sharing platform, so most of the information you provide us is Information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you follow, the Content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your profile information and public Content are immediately delivered to a wide range of users and other services that access THRONE. When you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Location Information:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In addition to profile information, you may also tell us your exact location if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as tagging a video with a location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with Content that has been tagged near your location.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Links:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Cookies:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Like many websites, we use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as viewing public videos. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk. THRONE may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not want cookies from THRONE or other websites, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>

We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, view videos hosted by THRONE, or interact with our email notifications. THRONE uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>
