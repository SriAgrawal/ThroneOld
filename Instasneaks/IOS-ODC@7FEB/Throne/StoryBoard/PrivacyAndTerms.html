THRONE receives your information through our mobile applications, websites, email notifications, and other interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

    <p><b>Information Collection and Use</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Creating a THRONE Account and Profile Information:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>When you create a THRONE account, you must provide access credentials either in the form of an email address and password or by authentication using another service, such as Facebook or Twitter. You may optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a short bio, location, and profile picture. If you create your THRONE account by connecting through another service, we may use public information from that connected account to help complete your THRONE profile. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time. Profile information is available publicly on our Services, such as on your profile page.Contact Information: In addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may use this information to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and facilitate your use of the Services. We may use the contact information (such as your phone number or email address) to help connect you with other THRONE users, even if that information is not publicly displayed.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Content, Following, and other Public Information:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>THRONE is a picture sharing platform, so most of the information you provide us is Information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you follow, the Content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your profile information and public Content are immediately delivered to a wide range of users and other services that access THRONE. When you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Location Information:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In addition to profile information, you may also tell us your exact location if you choose to enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as tagging a video with a location, and to improve and customize the Services, for example, with Content that has been tagged near your location.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Links:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Cookies:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Like many websites, we use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as viewing public videos. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk. THRONE may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. If you do not want cookies from THRONE or other websites, you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p><b>Log Data:</b></p>

Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application IDs, search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, view videos hosted by THRONE, or interact with our email notifications. THRONE uses Log Data to provide our Services and to measure, customize, and improve them. If not already done earlier, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p><b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>THRONE uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics.

    <p></p>
    <p><b>Law and Harm:</b></p>

    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Business Transfers:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>In the event that THRONE is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>
    <p></p>

THIS AGREEMENT SETS FORTH THE LEGALLY BINDING TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE AT WWW.THRONE.XYZ (THE “SITE”), MOBILE APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY THRONE (COLLECTIVELY, THE “SERVICES”).</p>
    <p>By using the Services in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Site, you (the “user” or “you”) agree to be bound by this Agreement, including those additional terms and conditions and policies referenced herein and/or available by hyperlink. This Agreement applies to all users of the Services, including without limitation users who are vendors, customers, merchants, contributors of content, information and other materials or services on the Site.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>THRONE is a Platform</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>THRONE serves as a platform to allow users who comply with THRONE’s policies to offer, sell and buy certain goods within a fixed-price format. THRONE is not directly involved in the transaction between buyers and sellers. As a result, THRONE has no control over the quality, safety, morality or legality of any aspect of the items listed, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to pay for items. THRONE does not pre-screen users (except for services that require an application) or the content or information provided by users. THRONE cannot ensure that a buyer or seller will actually complete a transaction.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Consequently, THRONE does not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to the buyer.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>THRONE cannot guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a user. THRONE encourages you to communicate directly with potential transaction partners through the tools available on the Site. You may also wish to consider using a third-party escrow service or services that provide additional user verification.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>You agree that THRONE is a platform and as such is not responsible or liable for any content, for example, data, text, information, usernames, graphics, images, photographs, profiles, audio, video, items, and links posted by you, other users, or outside parties on THRONE. You use the THRONE service at your own risk.</p>

THRONE may, in its sole discretion, refuse to offer access to or use of the Services to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. This provision is void where prohibited by law and the right to access the Services is revoked in such jurisdictions.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p><b>Fees and Billing:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Joining THRONE is free (excluding additional sales channels on THRONE that may have separate fees). THRONE charges fees for a percentage of the sale price when the item sells. When you list an item, you have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. THRONE’s Fees Policy, which is subject to change, is incorporated into this Agreement. Changes to the Fees Policy and the fees for THRONE’s services are effective after THRONE provides you with at least fourteen (14) days’ notice by posting the changes on the Site. However, THRONE may choose to temporarily change the Fees Policy and the fees for THRONE’s services for promotional events (for example, fee-free days); such changes are effective when THRONE posts the temporary promotional event on the Site. THRONE may, at THRONE’s sole discretion, change some or all of THRONE’s services at any time. In the event THRONE introduces a new service, the fees for that service are effective at the launch of the service. Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in US Dollars (USD).</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Fees Policy: You are responsible for paying all fees and applicable taxes associated with using THRONE. When you make a sale on THRONE, you will be charged a transaction fee of 15% of the item price. This percentage does not include the shipping cost or tax. Transaction fees are deducted automatically during the payment process.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Listing and Selling:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Listing Description: All listings on THRONE must be for sale. By listing an item on the Site you warrant that you and all aspects of the item comply with THRONE’s published policies. You also warrant that you may legally sell the item. You must accurately describe your item and all terms of sale in your THRONE listing. Your listings may only include text descriptions, graphics, pictures and other content relevant to the sale of that item. All items must be listed in an appropriate category with appropriate tags. Each listing must accurately and completely describe the item/items for sale in that listing. Each unique item must have its own listing.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Binding Sale:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Sellers are responsible for accurately listing their items, and buyers are responsible for reading the description of items before making a purchase. All sales are binding. The seller is obligated to ship the order or otherwise complete the transaction with the buyer in a prompt manner, unless there is an exceptional circumstance, such as: (a) the buyer fails to meet the terms of the seller’s listing (such as payment amount), or (b) the seller cannot authenticate the buyer’s identity. The buyer is obligated to deliver appropriate payment for items purchased, unless there is an exceptional circumstance.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Fee Avoidance:</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The price stated in each item listing description must be an accurate representation of the sale. Sellers may not complete deals off THRONE or otherwise avoid fees. You may not alter the item’s price after a sale for the purpose of avoiding THRONE transaction fees, misrepresent the item’s location, or use another user’s account without permission.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><b>Prohibited, Questionable and Infringing Items and Activities</b></p>

    <p></p>
    <p><b>Content</b></p>

    <p>Idea Submissions: THRONE considers any unsolicited suggestions, ideas, proposals or other material submitted to it by users via the Site, mobile applications, or otherwise (other than the Content and the tangible items sold on the Site by users) (collectively, the “Material”) to be non-confidential and non-proprietary, and THRONE shall not be liable for the disclosure or use of such Material. If, at THRONE’s request, any member sends Material to improve the site (for example through the Forums or to customer support), THRONE will also consider that Material to be non-confidential and non-proprietary and THRONE will not be liable for use or disclosure of the Material. Any communication by you to THRONE is subject to this Agreement. You hereby grant and agree to grant THRONE, under all of your rights in the Material, a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully-paid, sublicensable and transferable right and license to incorporate, use, publish and exploit such Material for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, including but not limited to incorporating it in the API, documentation, or any product or service, without compensation or accounting to you and without further recourse by you.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p><b>Information Control</b></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>THRONE does not control the Content provided by users that is made available on THRONE. You may find some Content to be offensive, harmful, inaccurate, or deceptive. There are also risks of dealing with underage persons or people acting under false pretense.</p>
